# Warehouse Management System (WMS)

A modern, React-based Warehouse Management System for comprehensive inventory, product, and order management. Built with React 18, Redux, and Tailwind CSS.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18+ (recommended)
- **npm** or **yarn** package manager

### Frontend Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm start
```

The application will open at `http://localhost:3000` by default.

### Production Build

```bash
npm run build
```

### Optional: Stripe Payment Server

If you're using payment functionality:

```bash
cd stripe-server
npm install
npm start
```

The Stripe server will run on a separate port (typically 3001 or as configured).

## 🔄 Application Flow

### Typical User Journey

1. **Initialization**

   - `index.js` mounts the React app with Redux store and routing
   - Redux Persist rehydrates app state from localStorage
   - Auth context loads user session if available

2. **Navigation**

   - `App.js` defines all routes and main layout
   - Protected routes use `security.jsx` guards to verify authentication
   - Navigation between admin modules and settings

3. **Data Operations**

   - Components call custom hooks (e.g., `useGetData.js`) to fetch data
   - Actions dispatch Redux actions via `IchthusSlice.js`
   - State updates trigger component re-renders

4. **Payment Processing** (if enabled)
   - Frontend triggers payment flows
   - Requests routed to `stripe-server` for secure processing
   - Results returned to frontend for UI updates

## 🛠️ Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
# API Configuration
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Stripe (if using payments)
REACT_APP_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=your_stripe_public_key_here
```

### Stripe Server Configuration

Edit `stripe-server/` for payment processing:

- Configure Stripe API keys
- Set up webhook endpoints
- Handle payment status updates

## 📦 Dependencies

### Key Frontend Libraries

- `react` - UI framework
- `react-redux` - Redux bindings
- `@reduxjs/toolkit` - Redux state management
- `react-router-dom` - Client routing
- `tailwindcss` - Utility CSS framework
- `axios` - HTTP client
- `socket.io-client` - Real-time updates
- `react-hot-toast` - Notifications
- `recharts` - Charting library
- `date-fns` - Date utilities

See `package.json` for complete dependency list.

## 🚦 Available Scripts

```bash
# Start development server with hot reload
npm start

# Build for production
npm run build

# Run tests
npm test

# Eject from Create React App (one-way operation)
npm run eject
```

## 🔐 Security Considerations

- Sensitive data stored in environment variables, not in code
- Protected routes verified in `security.jsx`
- User authentication via Auth context
- Payment data handled by Stripe (never stored locally)
- Redux Persist stores non-sensitive UI state only

## 📊 Development Workflow

1. **Create Feature Branches**

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/module-name
   ```

2. **Add a New Admin Module**

   - Create folder under `src/components/Admin/ModuleName/`
   - Create module component and sub-components
   - Add Redux slice if state needed
   - Create route in `App.js`
   - Add navigation link

3. **Component Structure**

   - Module container component
   - Feature-specific sub-components
   - Module dialog/modal for CRUD operations
   - Custom hooks for data operations

4. **Testing**
   - Write tests in `src/` alongside components
   - Run with `npm test`
   - Aim for critical path coverage

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Port 3000 Already in Use

```bash
# Find and kill the process using port 3000
# Or use a different port:
PORT=3001 npm start
```

### Redux DevTools

Enable Redux DevTools browser extension to inspect state and actions in real-time.

### Clear Local Storage

Open browser DevTools → Application → Local Storage → Clear All

## 📈 Performance Tips

- Use code splitting for large modules
- Lazy load routes with `React.lazy()`
- Memoize expensive computations
- Debounce search and filter operations
- Use Redux selectors to prevent unnecessary re-renders
