    question: "What is this for? Do I need it?",
    answer:
      'This is a powerful tool for adding a large number of inventory items (especially those with serial numbers) at once from a spreadsheet. The data is "staged" for you to review before it goes live in your inventory.',
    id: "upload-excel-inventory",
  },

    icon: "üé®",
    title: "Colors / Locations / Products",
    question: "Why would the same product be priced differently?",
    answer:
      'This setup allows for price variations. For example, a "Large T-Shirt" might cost more if it\'s "Red" (Color) or if it\'s sold at your "Premium Mall" branch (Location). The "Products" page is where you define the base item before adding these variations.',
    id: "colors-locations-products",
  },

    icon: "üßë",
    title: "Customers",
    question: "Is this my list of sales contacts?",
    answer:
      "Yes. This is the master list of all your customers. You can add new customers, edit their details, or view their purchase history from here.",
    id: "customers",
  },
  {
    icon: "üßæ",
    title: "Transactions",
    question: "What is the difference between this and the POS page?",
    answer:
      "This page is your sales history. It shows a complete list of all past purchase transactions. The POS page is where you create new transactions.",
    id: "transactions",
  },
  {
    icon: "üíª",
    title: "POS (Point of Sale)",
    question: "What does this screen do?",
    answer:
      "This is the main event! The POS screen is the virtual cash register where your staff will select items, process payments, and complete sales with customers.",
    id: "pos",
